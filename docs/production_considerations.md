The current block streamer implementation serves as a simplified monolithic example to demonstrate the core concepts. While functional, it intentionally omits production-level complexities in favor of clarity and ease of understanding.

## Monitoring and Observability

The system requires multi-level monitoring spanning infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network) and application-specific metrics (block processing rates, provider interactions). Grafana dashboards will visualize performance indicators and trends. Provider health monitoring focuses on response times, error rates, and block data freshness. Alert thresholds will be configured for error rates exceeding 5%, response times above 2 seconds, rate limit consumption, and block sequence gaps.

## Future Improvements

Core improvements include implementing Kafka for message queuing and Redis for caching to enhance system resilience. Implementation of CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive testing with provider mocks, and automated failover mechanisms will ensure system reliability. Cost optimization mechanisms will be implemented for efficient provider management.

## Real-World Architecture

The production environment requires a microservices architecture replacing the current monolithic implementation. The Provider Health Service will manage health monitoring and failure detection with historical data analysis. The Block Processing Service will handle block fetching with retry mechanisms and parallel processing. A Load Balancing Service will route requests based on provider health and costs. The Metrics and Monitoring Service will manage system metrics and alerting, while the API Gateway will handle rate limiting and authentication.

This architecture enables independent scaling, isolated failure domains, and service-specific resource optimization. The distributed system design provides the necessary foundation for production-scale operations and reliability requirements.
